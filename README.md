# data-analysis---CNN-vs-RNN

The used data for the project is from
J. J. Bird, L. J. Manso, E. P. Ribiero, A. Ekart, and D. R. Faria, “A study on mental state classification using eeg-based brain-machine interface,”in 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 2018.

The aim of the project is to compare the results from using CNN and RNN models to see if using a CNN model is a valid option for analysis of time series data.
